        (Jan 2024 - June 2024)</i></p>
        <p>
            After a pretty rough sleeping patch in my junior year of high school and a buzz slowly cackling for neurotech, I found a beautiful intersection. By trying to experiment around with my sleep and tamper with neurotech concepts, I can gain a better understanding whilst working to improve my life. Here it is!

        <p>Got to present my work at the NIH 10th Annual BRAIN Initiative Conference, where I got to meet many different scientists and Post-Docs and learn a lot!</p>

        <p><b>Stability - Mood Tracker</b>: Leveraging Face Images to Improve Mental Health Outcomes. </p><p><i style="background-color: peachpuff;">(July 2024 - June 2025)</i></p>
        <p>July 28th, 2024. 11:03 am.</p>
        <p>I'm walking around in my room, my mind permutating endlessly. What if...? Why not...? Neurotech? Projects? It covered different aspects... until it landed on one beautiful thought.</p>
        <p><i>Why can't your phone, that uses Face-ID, also read your mood as well?</i></p>
        <p>That marked the start of almost a year-long project working to shift the frontier of mental health, leveraging AI, Swift, and photo analysis to improve mental health outcomes on electronic devices.</p>
        <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stability-moodtracker/id6739185313">Check it out on the App Store!</a>
        <p><b>Currently, we've got 95+ downloads across 12+ countries, and a consensus 5-star rating as well!</b></p>

        <p><b>FoodTrack</b> - Utilizing AI and photo analysis to allow people to make more informed choices with their consumption.</p><p><i style="background-color: peachpuff;"> (July 2025 - Current. Backed by UVA Engineering)</i></p>

        <!-- add prototype demos, content so far, and backing with first hire -->
         <p>One of the most fun moments with my friends also happened to be one where I realized something strange.</p>
         <p>Our freedom on this trip was endless. We ate whatever we wanted to.</p>
         <p>And we were 2 months before college—a genuine place of endless freedom.</p>
         <p>So I wondered, from a set of infleunces, <i>do we actually know what the food that we're eating is actually doing to us?</i></p>
         <p><i>How are we so sure that the food we're eating is not harming us endlessly?</i></p>
         <p>That slowly worked to birth FoodTrack, my way of envisioning a better life by allowing people to get information regarding their food to make better choices in their life.</p>

         <p>Currently, a prototype has been finalized, and marketing is well-underway as I yearn to learn more about the problem around me.</p>
         <p><b>I've also pitched to the CEO of Reddit, an affiliate at NotYetVentures, and am working closely with UVA's Dietitian to validate the processes and bring this to life!</b></p>

        <p><b>Research Proposal: A Personalized Device for Real-Time Detection and Classification of Epileptic Seizures</b> — Abhiram Ruthala and Kenneth Sarip</p><p><i style="background-color: peachpuff;"> (Nov 2023 - Jan 2024.)</i></p>

        <!-- add prototype demos, content so far, and backing with first hire -->
         <p>Proposed and developed a novel way to detect seizures earlier using Machine Learning (ML), the Daubechies Wavelet of Order 2, Fast Wavelet, and an EEG-NIRS hybrid component for simultaneous data and better information transfer rates.

         <p><b>Upcoming Project: Leveraging EEG to Improve Communication for Paralyzed Patients (Amnesia-Affected)</b></p>
        <p>
            Realizing the developing potential of EEGs in BCIs as well as thinking heavily about faster ways to record ideas, I'm starting to experiment with the use of EEGs on relative communication without the use of the mouth.</p>
        <P>By experimenting around with different frequencies, wavelengths, and overall data compositions, I can configure a specific "keyboard" where people, who don't comprise of the ability to speak, can attempt to speak with a moderately high bit-rate.</P>
        <p>This gives the chance for people to not feel left behind in conversation, make sure their thoughts are voiced, and that their needs are met.</p>
        <p>This is a deeply exciting project that I'm only in the early stages for, but there's a lot to come in the near future!</p>
