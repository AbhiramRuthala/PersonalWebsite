            Here are some projects that I've worked on:

        <p><b>SleepMO</b> - Leveraging Signal-To-Noise ratio of EEG signals to provide sleep recommendations. 
        </p><p>

        (Jan 2024 - June 2024)</i></p>
        <p>
            After a pretty rough sleeping patch in my junior year of high school and a buzz slowly cackling for neurotech, I found a beautiful intersection. By trying to experiment around with my sleep and tamper with neurotech concepts, I can gain a better understanding whilst working to improve my life. Here it is!

        <p>Got to present my work at the NIH 10th Annual BRAIN Initiative Conference, where I got to meet many different scientists and Post-Docs and learn a lot!</p>

        <p><b>Stability - Mood Tracker</b>: Leveraging Face Images to Improve Mental Health Outcomes. </p><p><i style="background-color: peachpuff;">(July 2024 - June 2025)</i></p>
        <p>July 28th, 2024. 11:03 am.</p>
        <p>I'm walking around in my room, my mind permutating endlessly. What if...? Why not...? Neurotech? Projects? It covered different aspects... until it landed on one beautiful thought.</p>
        <p>Why can't your phone, that uses Face-ID, also read your mood as well?</p>
        <p>That marked the start of almost a year-long project working to shift the frontier of mental health, leveraging AI, Swift, and photo analysis to improve mental health outcomes on electronic devices.</p>
        <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stability-moodtracker/id6739185313">Check it out on the App Store!</a>
        <p>Currently, we've got 95+ downloads across 12+ countries, and a consensus 5-star rating as well!</p>

        <p><b>FoodTrack</b> - Utilizing AI and photo analysis to allow people to make more informed choices with their consumption.</p><p><i style="background-color: peachpuff;"> (July 2025 - Current. Backed by UVA Engineering)</i></p>

        <!-- add prototype demos, content so far, and backing with first hire -->
         <p>One of the most fun moments with my friends also happened to be one where I realized something strange.</p>
         <p>Our freedom on this trip was endless. We ate whatever we wanted to.</p>
         <p>And we were 2 months before college—a genuine place of endless freedom.</p>
         <p>So I wondered, from a set of infleunces, <i>do we actually know what the food that we're eating is actually doing to us?</i></p>
         <p><i>How are we so sure that the food we're eating is not harming us endlessly?</i></p>
         <p>That slowly worked to birth FoodTrack, my way of envisioning a better life by allowing people to get information regarding their food to make better choices in their life.</p>

         <a href="https://www.instagram.com/foodtrack.app/">Check out the app's Instagram page!</a>
         <p>Currently, a prototype has been finalized, and marketing is well-underway as I yearn to learn more about the problem around me.</p>

        <p><b>Research Proposal: A Personalized Device for Real-Time Detection and Classification of Epileptic Seizures</b> — Abhiram Ruthala and Kenneth Sarip</p><p><i style="background-color: peachpuff;"> (Nov 2023 - Jan 2024.)</i></p>

        <!-- add prototype demos, content so far, and backing with first hire -->
         <p>Proposed and developed a novel way to detect seizures earlier using Machine Learning (ML), the Daubechies Wavelet of Order 2, Fast Wavelet, and an EEG-NIRS hybrid component for simultaneous data and better information transfer rates.
