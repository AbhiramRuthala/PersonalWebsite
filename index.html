            I'm a student at UVA studying biomedical engineering. Outside of that, I love building projects, taking photos, and playing basketball.

        <p>
            I'm very interested in the field of BCIs and Neurotech. From paralysis rehab to new mind methodologies, there's so much that can be done that barely scratches the surface.

                I want to be a part of that.

        <p>So, that's my elevator pitch. Below are a few more tangible resources that can give you more clarity!</p>

                Here are some things that shook my mind.

             Here are some ways to live life:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Be curious - People have so much knowledge. Learn to ask!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Think for yourself - As much as other people's opinions can influence yours, it's ultimately yours that matters most. Learn to make the most of it!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Knowledge compounds with application - Learn to "see" your knowledge in the world around you. It's amazing!
                    </p>
                </li>
                
            </ul>
