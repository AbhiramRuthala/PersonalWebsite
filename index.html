            Hi! I'm Abhiram Ruthala. I'm a first-year student at UVA studying biomedical engineering. Outside of that, I love building projects, taking photos, and playing basketball.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm very interested in the field of BCIs and Neurotech. From paralysis rehab to new mind methodologies, there's so much that can be done that barely scratches the surface. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
                I want to be a part of that.
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>I've worked in sleep and mental health technology, and am now dabbling into nutrition/food-health for the overall body!</p>
        <p>So, that's my elevator pitch. Below are a few more tangible resources that can give you more clarity!</p>
        <!-- <p>
            Some things I've done:
            - Built a sleep tracker
        </p> -->

                I like to write. Here are some pieces I've wrote: 
                <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://abhiramruthala.substack.com/p/going-back-to-beginner-mode">Going back to beginner mode</a>
                </li>

                </li>
                
            </ul>

            </p>
            These are some of my principles for life:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Be curious - People have so much knowledge. Learn to ask!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Think for yourself - As much as other people's opinions can influence yours, it's ultimately yours that matters most. Learn to make the most of it!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Knowledge compounds with application - Learn to "see" your knowledge in the world around you. It's amazing!
                    </p>
                </li>
                
            </ul>

            My philosophy?

            <b>Do unorthodox things. Life's richness is what you give to it.</b>
